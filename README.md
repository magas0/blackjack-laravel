# Blackjack Game Demo
You will be creating a Blackjack card game that will consist of 2 players--the dealer and ONE player.
The game will have 1 standard deck of 52 cards.
The game will have 4 controls:
- New Game
- Hit
- Stand
- Deal

The game should continue until 60% of the cards have been used. Upon reaching that point the game will end.
The game will keep track of how many hands were won and lost by the player.
To begin with the dealer and player will receive 2 cards. The player has the option to "Hit" or "Stand".
Once the player stands the dealer will play out his hand.
The dealer must hit at 16 or lower. And must stand on 17 and above.
